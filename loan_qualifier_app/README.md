# Loan Qualifier Application - Module 2 Challenge baby!!!

Just after the title, introduce your project by describing attractively what the project is about and what is the main problem that inspires you to create this project or what is the main contribution for the potential user of your project.

For this project, we wanted to run a list of qualifying loans for an applicant and allow them to save the list to a CSV file if they so choose to.  If they didn't qualify for a loan from any of the banks, we would not present them with the option to save a list to a csv file but exit the system with a message letting them know they didn't qualify.
